## Objetivo
Logging in to bandit26 from bandit25 should be fairly easy… The shell for user bandit26 is not **/bin/bash**, but something else. Find out what it is, how it works and how to break out of it.

> NOTE: if you’re a Windows user and typically use Powershell to `ssh` into bandit: Powershell is known to cause issues with the intended solution to this level. You should use command prompt instead.
